# SASS Tricks

This should simple be an easy to use repository of partials that can be thrown at any project using bower, or good old copy/paste. It's main repository can be found on github at
[https://github.com/Windgazer-Freelance/sasstricks][duh].

## Development

To do development on this project simply clone it (fork first if your don't have
write-access ;) ) and make sure you have [npm][1], [SASS][2] and [styledocco][3]
installed. The following command should be of interest:

- `npm install`, installs all dependencies and compiles the project.
- `grunt host`, compiles the project, hosts it on localhost:8282 and recompiles on change.

What could be of interest is that the `grunt host` command includes a live-reload server
so you can use a live-reload plugin with your browser to connect and reload on changes.
