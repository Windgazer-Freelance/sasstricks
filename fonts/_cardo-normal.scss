#Cardo Normal

The Cardo family is a nice traditional serif set that still prints/reads well at
relatively small font-sizes, I like it ;)

```
<p class="cardo-n big">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack.</p>
<p class="cardo-n medium">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack.</p>
<p class="cardo-n small">Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack.</p>
```

%cardo-normal {
    font-family: 'Cardo', serif;
    @at-root {
        @import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cardo);

}
